Welcome! I am Loïc Denuzière aka "Tarmil", and this is my technical blog.
I'm a French developer who's quite passionate about functional programming, and I've been using F# for most of my work for over eight years.

I've been one of the main developers of [WebSharper](https://websharper.com), the F# web framework with both server-side and JavaScript-compiled client-side tools.
Recently I've been focusing more on [Bolero](https://fsbolero.io), a library that runs F# applications in WebAssembly using Blazor, and other personal projects.
